# Open Type playground
A playground for Open Type experiments with CSS. A follow up demo to [this blog post](http://blog.ricardofilipe.com/post/deep-into-opentype-features) about OpenType features.

A working demo can be [found here](http://open-type.surge.sh).

### Locally

You can run these examples locally, but please note that the custom typefaces won't be available under any other domain.

`npm install`
`npm start`

Alternatively, launch the `index.html` manually.
